    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am learning core areas of computer science and using this website in combination with github to build and showcase projects as I develop my technical skills.</p>
    <p>I enjoy problem-solving and logical thinking, both in programming and through hobbies like playing Magic: The Gathering.</p>
    <p>Alongside my studies, I currently work at McDonald’s, where I’ve developed strong teamwork and time-management skills, and I am actively working towards a career in technology.</p>
